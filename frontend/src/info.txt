How many minimum number of data points for each condition?
Minimum is 4 data points. In Neuroscience, 48
How many items do we need?
If we have 3 conditions, then in the behavioural domain reading study, we only need 4 data points per condition. 3 x 4 = 12 buttons. It'd be fine to have more. 48 x 3 = 144. Signal to noise ratio. Need to bring that up. 
Two purposes
- ensures that each condition is tested equally
- ensures that each participant will be tested on each condition an equal number of times

In behavoiural domain, it'll be 3 x 4 = 12 so the last one in a counterbalancing list will be 12 callback
In a neuroscience domain, it'll be item 48 callback


Each item and condition is called trial. What exactly does trial mean? A trial is a one event that occurs in an experiment. We show 1 trial. Then a break. Then another trial. Of course, we also randomize(pseudo-randomization or constrained randomization)

Left justify the first page(paragraphs and headers and button too)
Make sure it fits in one line
Collect statistics. Average and standard deviation. Regression analysis

Make  lab 4. False study(whole sentence). Eye tracker is hard to have and privacy issues???

Meeting on November 3rd, Friday at 3pm at Mako's office

Nov 3
If you give me a text file, then counterbalance it and show shuffling/randomization error
After counterbalancing worked, see the outcome

equal number of conditions coming from different items

After all the lists, it shows that each condition item was only tested once

Have an equal number of participants assigned to each list
